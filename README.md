# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a crucial field in artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. This repository provides practical examples of fundamental NLP tasks using two popular libraries: NLTK and SpaCy.

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you need to install the required libraries. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uumair327/natural_language_processing.git
   cd natural_language_processing


2. Install the required Python packages:
Ensure you have NLTK and SpaCy installed. You may need to download the necessary NLTK data and SpaCy model:


Notebook Contents
The notebook NLP01.ipynb covers the following topics:

Stop Word Removal
Stop words are common words that usually do not carry significant meaning and can be removed from text data to reduce noise. This section demonstrates how to remove stop words using NLTK.

Stemming
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. This notebook demonstrates stemming using the Porter Stemmer and Lancaster Stemmer from NLTK.

Lemmatization
Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, taking into account the context. This notebook demonstrates lemmatization using the WordNet Lemmatizer from NLTK and the SpaCy library.

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook NLP01.ipynb
Follow the instructions and run the code cells to see the NLP preprocessing steps in action.
